 My previous coding expierience includes taking a class in python the summer of my freshman year as well as taking two java courses over the summer. I am excited to be taking this class because I want to expand my knowledge of coding. Some other interests I have is creative writing, as well as learning histoy, and biology (Computational biology also being an interest of mine). My goals in this class is to improve my fluency in Java, as well as learn JavaScript and possibly other coding languages.
