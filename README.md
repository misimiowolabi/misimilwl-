 My previous coding expierience includes taking a class in python the summer before my freshman year as well as taking some Java courses the summer before my sophomore year, and I took Computer Science 1 Honors my sophomore year. I am excited to be taking this class because I want to expand my knowledge of coding. Some other interests I have is writing, sports, biology. My goals in this class is to improve my fluency in JavaScript, as well as continue to explore other programming languages.
